# Solidity developer roadmap


##  Solidity by example

### Key words:
* functions:
** external: this function can only be called from outside of this contract 
** pure:     this function does not write anything to the blockchain
* variables:
** state variable
    stable variable: stored on blockchain, So you can save some data into a state variable, come back a week later and the data will still be there.
** local variable

** global variable
